# Contributing to Eclipse Java development tools

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The JDT project provides the tool plug-ins that implement a Java IDE supporting
the development of any Java application, including Eclipse plug-ins. It adds a
Java project nature and Java perspective to the Eclipse Workbench as well as a
number of views, editors, wizards, builders, and code merging and refactoring
tools. The JDT project allows Eclipse to be a development environment for
itself.
