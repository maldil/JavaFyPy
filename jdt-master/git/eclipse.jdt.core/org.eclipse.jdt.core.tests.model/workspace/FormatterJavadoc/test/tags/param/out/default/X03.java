	 *            The first parameter. For an optimum result, this should be an
	 *            odd number between 0 and 100. We may also want to know if the
	 *            formatter is able to handle more than two lines in a tag
	 *            description.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * @param b
	 *            The second parameter. Same test than for first parameter: we
	 *            also want to know if the formatter is able to handle more than
	 *            two lines in a tag description. But this time this description
	 *            is split on several lines which may make the work a little bit
	 *            more difficult to do...
