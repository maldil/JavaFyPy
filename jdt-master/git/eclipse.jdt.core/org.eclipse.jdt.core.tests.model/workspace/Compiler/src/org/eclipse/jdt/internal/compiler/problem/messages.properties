546 = Cannot perform instanceof check against parameterized type {0}. Use instead its raw form {1} since generic type information will be erased at runtime
547 = Cannot perform instanceof check against type parameter {0}. Use instead its erasure {1} since generic type information will be erased at runtime
548 = The method {0}({1}) of type {2} is not generic; it cannot be parameterized with arguments <{3}>
549 = Incorrect number of type arguments for generic method <{3}>{0}({1}) of type {2}; it cannot be parameterized with arguments <{4}>
550 = The parameterized method <{3}>{0}({1}) of type {2} is not applicable for the arguments ({4})
551 = The constructor {0}({1}) of type {2} is not generic; it cannot be parameterized with arguments <{3}>
552 = Incorrect number of type arguments for generic constructor <{3}>{0}({1}) of type {2}; it cannot be parameterized with arguments <{4}>
553 = The parameterized constructor <{3}>{0}({1}) of type {2} is not applicable for the arguments ({4})
554 = The method {0}({1}) of raw type {2} is no more generic; it cannot be parameterized with arguments <{3}>
555 = The constructor {0}({1}) of raw type {2} is no more generic; it cannot be parameterized with arguments <{3}>
556 = The type {1} cannot extend or implement {0}. A supertype may not specify any wildcard
557 = The generic class {0} may not subclass java.lang.Throwable
558 = Illegal class literal for the type parameter {0}
559 = Unsafe type operation: The return type {0} of the method {1}({2}) of type {3} needs unchecked conversion to conform to the return type {4} of inherited method
560 = Name clash : The method {0}({1}) of type {2} has the same erasure as {0}({3}) of type {4} but does not override it
561 = The member type {0}<{1}> must be qualified with a parameterized type, since it is not static
562 = The member type {0} must be parameterized, since it is qualified with a parameterized type
563 = The member type {0} cannot be qualified with a parameterized type, since it is static. Remove arguments from qualifying type {1}

### FOREACH
580 = Type mismatch: cannot convert from element type {0} to {1}
581 = Can only iterate over an array or an instance of java.lang.Iterable

### SOURCE LEVEL
590 = Syntax error, type parameters are only available if source level is 1.5
591 = Syntax error, static imports are only available if source level is 1.5
592 = Syntax error, ''for each'' statements are only available if source level is 1.5
593 = Syntax error, parameterized types are only available if source level is 1.5
594 = Syntax error, enum declarations are only available if source level is 1.5
595 = Syntax error, varargs are only available if source level is 1.5
596 = Syntax error, annotations are only available if source level is 1.5
597 = Syntax error, annotation declarations are only available if source level is 1.5

### ANNOTATIONS
600 = This annotation type member declaration has a constructor name
601 = Extended dimensions are illegal in an annotation type member declaration
602 = Package annotations must be in file package-info.java

### CORRUPTED BINARIES
700 = The class file {0} contains a signature ''{1}'' ill-formed at position {2}
